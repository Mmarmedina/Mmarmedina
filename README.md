About me: 

📚 Full Stack Web Developer, focused on Angular and .NET.

🖥️ I currently work as a Junior Fullstack Developer at Bravent.

✅ For over ten years, I've been designed and created websites using WordPress, which has given me a 360-degree understanding of how to create and manage digital products (design, usability, performance, content creation, etc.).

👩‍🏫 On inpartytura.com (a website dedicated to piano learning for beginners), I aim to merge my passion for teaching, music, and the online world. In addition to handling content creation and writing for the website, I've been responsible for its creation and design using WordPress and various plugins for this CMS (including the Thrive Quiz Builder gamification plugin). I also have knowledge of SEO and have contributed to the website's positioning strategy.

👩 Soft-skills: I am responsible, perseverant, organized, and proactive. I enjoy working in teams, taking on new challenges, and learning new things. I studied a Degree in Human Resources.
