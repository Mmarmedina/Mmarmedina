About me: 

📚 Full Stack Web Developer, focused on Angular and .NET.

✅ For over ten years, I've been involved in designing and creating websites using WordPress, which has given me a 360-degree understanding of how to create and manage digital products (design, usability, performance, content creation, etc.).

🖥️ I work as a Frontend Developer at Perfumerías Primor, an e-commerce platform with online presence in Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy, as part of the company's Web Management department.

👩‍🏫 On inpartytura.com (a website dedicated to piano learning for beginners), I aim to merge my passion for teaching, music, and the online world. In addition to handling content creation and writing for the website, I've been responsible for its creation and design using WordPress and various plugins for this CMS (including the Thrive Quiz Builder gamification plugin). I also have knowledge of SEO and have contributed to the website's positioning strategy.

👩 Soft-skills: I am responsible, perseverant, organized, and proactive. I enjoy working in teams, taking on new challenges, and learning new things. I studied a Degree in HR and Human Resources.
